We will check your program on integers or string inputs. We are providing
two different kinds of input files here. One for integers and the other 
for strings.

The name of the input file in the final submission of your code will be
"hw1bin". There are two output files that will be generated by your code.
The names of the output files will be "hw1bout1" and "hw1bout2". Note that
none of the input or output files have extensions.

For your convenience we are providing two diffrent kinds of files here for
string as well as integers. In your main function you will have to use an if
statement which will set the template parameter to either string or int
depending upon what the file is.

Format of input files
==========================
The first line has 4 elements. These are the number of dimensions of the
matrix. The fourth element is either 1 or 0. 1 stands for integer and 0
stands for string. So you can use this check of 1 and 0 in the if statement
in your main function.


Then the next line takes in elements of the first matrix. (Note that you are
reading in two matrices). The elements are read in the increasing order of
the last dimension. So, for this particular integer example file there are
2x2x2=8 elements. So first element that is read is 000, then 001, then 010,
then 011, then 100, then 101, then 110, and then finally 111.

In fact you can read in any other order also, but just be consistent in
reading both the matrices.

The next line reads the values of the second matrix.


Format of output files
============================
File1 (hw1bout1): This just contains the "sorted" vector of matrix additions.
File2 (hw1bout2): This contains the "sorted" list of words in the vector
that belonged to the dictionary.
