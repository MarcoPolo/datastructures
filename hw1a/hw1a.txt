1) p references the memory location of a so it will output the value of a which is 3

2) Seg fault, you are giving the value of a as an address for p

3) you change the values of a and b by using a pointer p to them, so the output will be 4 3 

4) you pass the memory location of a to p then to q then you increment the value at q by 5 which is also the value at p which returns 8

5) *p is the exact same value as a so it returns 1

6) should print Fred Jones since it references the memory location of s

7) type error from trying to convert a string* to and int*

8) First the compiler will complain the function isn't a valid type but if you define it as one then it will output 10

9) you change the value of a to become the value of b. the output it 44 

10) The output will be the memory location of the variable a

11) The output will be the value of a + 1 so it comes out to 5

12) This is risky it will output the value of whatever is in the next 4 bytes of memory

13) b becomes the character code 52 which is 4

14-15 ) cpp files

16) you initialize a new integer with ptr_a being the reference
    output:     
                3 3
                3 9
                3 3
                3 3
                0xBADCOFFEE(aka address at ptr_a) 3

   Checked! 

17) a) Done is never changed so it results in a nasty infinite loop that just keeps allocating at 10 MB at a time
    b) it runs until 16 before it tries to go after my slow swap space, I terminated before it threw an error, it should crash by itself when their is no more memory it can use
    c) Done
